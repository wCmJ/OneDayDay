single thread server model:
    non-blocking IO + IO multiplexing --- Reactor： 
        sturcture:
            event loop + event-driven + event callback
        examples:
            lighttpd 
            libevent, libev
            ACE, Poco C++ libraries
            Java NIO
            POE(Perl)
            Twisted(Python)
        disadvantage：
            callback must be non-blocking, for NIO that has request-response model, it will split business logic and is not easy to maintain.
        
    
multiple thread server model:
    one thread(one loop) for a request + blocking IO
                                
    thread pool + blocking IO
    
    non-blocking IO + IO multiplexing

1.runtime of task is 20s, use a process
2.runtime of task is 10 ms, use a thread    
3.runtime of task is 200us many times, use one thread/thread pool

only use single thread:
1.use fork
2.cpu limit
    cause this thread only use one core, in multi-core system, it will not impact other process and whole system.
